# TweetAnalysis
# This was a project in my Object Oriented Java to learn the foundation of Objected-Oriented software dev as well as basic back end implentation
# More specifically, this project creates an ArrayList to store tweet objects containing user info, tweet contents, and tweet ids.
# Using that arrayList, a user may add tweets, remove tweets, or search them.

# Later, I intend on adding a UI as well as possible twitter API integration to get real-time tweets. I also intend on adding a system for determining the polarity of a tweet by it's contents.
